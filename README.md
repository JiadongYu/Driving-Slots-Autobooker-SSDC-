# Driving-Slots-Autobooker-SSDC
Utilised Python, Selenium, Twilio and Windows task scheduler to automate the booking of practical lesson slots at Singapore Safety And Driving Centre (SSDC)

# Introduction
It is often difficult to obtain driving lesson slots as they are quickly snatched up once they are released. In addition, it is tedious and time-consuming to camp for these slots. This script aims to automate the process of booking driving slots once they become available. In addition, users are promptly notified via text once slots have been reserved for them so they can make payment quickly to secure their slots. Zero coding knowledge is required for new users to configure the script to their own needs. 

# Note
It is recommended to use the latest version of Google Chrome to allow for a smoother user experience and to minimise errors in the running of the script

# Step 1: Downloading & Configuring Selenium
Selenium is a piece of software that supports browser automation. We will use it to automate the process of navigating through the SSDC website to find our slots. Selenium (For Google Chrome) can be downloaded at https://sites.google.com/chromium.org/driver/ . You should download the version of Selenium that corresponds to the version of your Chrome browser to prevent incompatabilities and errors later on. Take note of the location of the downloaded Selenium driver as we will use it later on.
